<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Many studies have identified crucial factors that impact learner engagement in online courses, particularly free to join courses like MOOCs and have explored aspects of openness, freeness, production values, retention strategies and the impact of MOOCs on digital teaching and learning, but little has been said about learners who continue to revisit the same MOOC, their intention to revisit and then their behaviour when actually revisiting.</p> 
<p>This study explored the unique learner cohort of an open-ended skills-based MOOC and through the analysis of learner comments, it examined the behaviour, motivations and factors that contributed to learners revisiting the same MOOC over a five year period from 2015 to 2020. This study found that learners may first join the course for the content, but then choose to revisit for the community, course educators, content updates and enhancements, and for the impact that revisiting has on their behaviour and emotions.</p>
<p>This study also found that a significant number of learners revisited, some up to 10 times in consecutive sequence, while others revisited in a syncopated pattern. While the outcomes from this study may not be generalisable to MOOCs for all topic areas, insights gained may be of interest to designers curious about creating flexible, social, practical and skills-based experiences for lifelong learners.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Since their emergence in the mid-2000s, massive open online courses (MOOC) have been predicated on making learning available to everyone, and at scale. Much effort has been spent analysing data generated by MOOC participants (eg., Guo, Kim & Rubin 2014; Savage 2009; Wang 2017) across a variety
of MOOCs (eg., Engle, Mankoff & Carbrey 2015; Hew & Cheung 2008; Taib, Chuah & Aziz 2017) to
determine if video production methods (format, style, type and duration) and pedagogical dimensions
(cooperative learning, feedback, activities and assessments) are crucial for cultivating an engaging
learning experience. However, few studies have examined the specific cohorts of students who revisit
and their behaviour and motivations for revisiting.</p>
<p>The purpose of this research is to identify the factors that contribute to learners revisiting a MOOC. In
order to identify those factors we asked:</p>
	<p><strong>'What can we discover about the behaviour and motivations of revisiting learners from comments in
a MOOC and how can these findings inform the design of MOOCs in the future?'</strong></p>
