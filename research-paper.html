<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>Many studies have identified crucial factors that impact learner engagement in online courses, particularly free to join courses like MOOCs and have explored aspects of openness, freeness, production values, retention strategies and the impact of MOOCs on digital teaching and learning, but little has been said about learners who continue to revisit the same MOOC, their intention to revisit and then their behaviour when actually revisiting.</p> 
<p>This study explored the unique learner cohort of an open-ended skills-based MOOC and through the analysis of learner comments, it examined the behaviour, motivations and factors that contributed to learners revisiting the same MOOC over a five year period from 2015 to 2020. This study found that learners may first join the course for the content, but then choose to revisit for the community, course educators, content updates and enhancements, and for the impact that revisiting has on their behaviour and emotions.</p>
<p>This study also found that a significant number of learners revisited, some up to 10 times in consecutive sequence, while others revisited in a syncopated pattern. While the outcomes from this study may not be generalisable to MOOCs for all topic areas, insights gained may be of interest to designers curious about creating flexible, social, practical and skills-based experiences for lifelong learners.</p>
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Since their emergence in the mid-2000s, massive open online courses (MOOC) have been predicated on making learning available to everyone, and at scale. Much effort has been spent analysing data generated by MOOC participants (eg., Guo, Kim & Rubin 2014; Savage 2009; Wang 2017) across a variety
of MOOCs (eg., Engle, Mankoff & Carbrey 2015; Hew & Cheung 2008; Taib, Chuah & Aziz 2017) to
determine if video production methods (format, style, type and duration) and pedagogical dimensions
(cooperative learning, feedback, activities and assessments) are crucial for cultivating an engaging
learning experience. However, few studies have examined the specific cohorts of students who revisit
and their behaviour and motivations for revisiting.</p>
<p>The purpose of this research is to identify the factors that contribute to learners revisiting a MOOC. In
order to identify those factors we asked:</p>
	<p><strong>'What can we discover about the behaviour and motivations of revisiting learners from comments in
a MOOC and how can these findings inform the design of MOOCs in the future?'</strong></p>
	<h2>MOOC learners</h2>
	<p>Many learners take MOOCs to develop or build-on existing skills to enhance their future employability,
shape a goal for further study, connect with people, understand basic concepts or general understanding
and satisfy their curiosity (Zheng, Rosson, Shih and Carrol 2015). Laurillard (2014) noted that a number
of previous studies have shown that most MOOC users are already well educated. In Coursera MOOCs, for
example, an average of 85% of participants have one or more degrees. For London and Edinburgh-based
MOOCs offered in 2013, the figure was around 70%. In their examination of learners taking a five-week
'Introduction to Infographics and Data Visualization' MOOC, Liu, Kang and McKelroy (2015) found the top
two reasons for taking the MOOC were to learn more about the topic for personal reasons (employment
prospects/career readiness) and for their current job. Other main reasons included learning about future
career possibilities, what MOOCs are like, getting course materials, and learning from specific
instructor(s). Achieving a certificate (of completion) and engaging with MOOC takers as a community of
learners were also listed as reasons for taking the MOOC, but resulted in fewer responses. The results
from interviews by Zheng et al., (2015) with learners about their reasons for taking a MOOC support
findings of Liu et al., (2015), where learners revealed they took MOOCs to fulfil their current study
needs, help their current position (as a student or in the workplace), develop a social connection with
others who shared similar interests and also to prepare for future job opportunities or to gain experience
in a field they might study in a more formal manner after taking the MOOC (Zheng et al. 2015).
Reasons for learners taking a MOOC were further explored by Xiong, Kornhaber, Suen, Pursel & Goins
(2015), where they defined a general interest in taking a MOOC as intrinsic motivation, taking a MOOC
for external rewards, such as earning a certificate as extrinsic motivation, and taking a MOOC for
connecting with others as social motivation. As observed by Crues, Bosch, Anderson, Perry, Bhat and Shaik (2018), to this end, the subject matter of the course was also indicative of the reason a learner
might take a MOOC.</p>
	<p>Engle, Mankoff and Carbrey (2015) noted that understanding MOOC students and the characteristics that
lead to their success will enable modification to courses for increased student achievement, while Hew
and Cheung (2008) explored how to promote student contribution in asynchronous online discussions and
Taib, Chuah and Aziz (2017) investigated four unique MOOCs using Assessing MOOC Pedagogy (AMP) to
characterise ten pedagogical dimensions (1) Epistemology, (2) Role of teacher, (3) Focus of activities, (4)
Structure, (5) Approach to content, (6) Feedback, (7) Co-operative learning, (8) Accommodation of
individual differences, (9) Activities or assessments, and (10) User role. These factors noted by research
carried out across a variety of MOOCs (eg., Engle, Mankoff & Carbrey 2015; Hew & Cheung 2008; Taib,
Chuah & Aziz 2017) may seem elementary for a single instance or one-off run of a MOOC, but what of
revisiting learners - those learners who repeatedly join and then continue to actively participate in the
same MOOC over multiple instances? An example of this cohort would be the learners who continue to
		participate in Monash University’s <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/mindfulness-wellbeing-performance">‘Mindfulness for Wellbeing and Peak Performance’</a> and <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/mindfulness-life">‘Maintaining a Mindful
		Life’</a> free to join courses on <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a>.</p>
	<h2>Mindfulness at Monash</h2>
<p>Mindfulness is an everyday experience. It's about being fully present and fully engaged in each moment in our lives (Chambers 2020). Mindfulness is associated with paying attention and the evidence is suggesting that (training the attention and) learning to pay attention may be the most important skill we ever learn (Hassed n.d.) - it helps us to focus; to stay on task; to communicate more effectively and empathically; to not get caught in cycles of rumination and worry; and to enjoy life more, including life’s simple pleasures (Chambers & Hassed 2015).</p>
	<p>The development of 'Mindfulness for Wellbeing and Peak Performance' (MIND) and the follow-up
complementary ‘Maintaining a Mindful Life’ (MINDLIFE) emerged from Monash's long term interest in the
application of mindfulness in education settings and a partnership with UK-based online learning
platform FutureLearn, which culminated in the first run of MIND in 2015 (Chambers &amp; Hassed 2015).
Since then, a total of 328,091 learners enrolled in MIND across its 14 runs, while a total of 67,690
learners enrolled in MINDLIFE across its 8 runs since 2017. Class Central, an online course aggregator,
reports that <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/futurelearn-2019-year-review/">FutureLearn listed MIND as the fifth most popular courses by enrollment numbers since their
first release</a> (Bowden 2019). MIND and MINDLIFE are also listed on <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/collection/top-free-online-courses">Class Central’s Top 100 online courses
of all time</a> - a status based on reviews written by Class Central users.</p>
	<p>While both courses are predicated on mindfulness, in MIND learners cultivate mindfulness techniques to reduce stress and improve wellbeing and work/study performance (possibly for the first time). In MINDLIFE, learners cultivate mindfulness techniques to improve their communication, relationships and emotional health - it builds upon the introductory MIND course and demonstrates to learners how to embed mindfulness into all aspects of life. 
</p>
	<p>MIND and MINDLIFE are four week courses (although MIND was originally designed as a six week course and remained so from Run 1 to Run 7) with a time commitment of 3 hours per week to work through the course material and sample each mindfulness exercise. Sections of each course make extensive use of video (didactic content and bespoke weekly wrap-ups from lead educators) and audio (mindfulness meditations and exercises) as well as text-based explanations of mindfulness concepts. Quizzes, articles and additional reading are also included to provide learners with opportunities to check their understanding or dedicate more time to explore the science of mindfulness in more depth, and to provide additional information to where claims or references to research are made in the course. Given the experiential nature of the courses, learners are strongly encouraged to watch the videos, practise the mindfulness meditations and exercises, share their ideas, reflections and experiences and join in the discussions - each run of the course features two course mentors to ensure appropriate facilitation of the course.
