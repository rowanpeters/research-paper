<a name="Abstract"><h1>Abstract</h1></a>
<p>Many studies have identified crucial factors that impact learner engagement in online courses, particularly free to join courses like MOOCs and have explored aspects of openness, freeness, production values, retention strategies and the impact of MOOCs on digital teaching and learning, but little has been said about learners who continue to revisit the same MOOC, their intention to revisit and then their behaviour when actually revisiting.</p> 
<p>This study explored the unique learner cohort of an open-ended skills-based MOOC and through the analysis of learner comments, it examined the behaviour, motivations and factors that contributed to learners revisiting the same MOOC over a five year period from 2015 to 2020. This study found that learners may first join the course for the content, but then choose to revisit for the community, course educators, content updates and enhancements, and for the impact that revisiting has on their behaviour and emotions.</p>
<p>This study also found that a significant number of learners revisited, some up to 10 times in consecutive sequence, while others revisited in a syncopated pattern. While the outcomes from this study may not be generalisable to MOOCs for all topic areas, insights gained may be of interest to designers curious about creating flexible, social, practical and skills-based experiences for lifelong learners.</p>
	<a name="Introduction">
<h1>Introduction</h1></a>
<p>Since their emergence in the mid-2000s, massive open online courses (MOOC) have been predicated on making learning available to everyone, and at scale. Much effort has been spent analysing data generated by MOOC participants (eg., Guo, Kim & Rubin 2014; Savage 2009; Wang 2017) across a variety
of MOOCs (eg., Engle, Mankoff & Carbrey 2015; Hew & Cheung 2008; Taib, Chuah & Aziz 2017) to
determine if video production methods (format, style, type and duration) and pedagogical dimensions
(cooperative learning, feedback, activities and assessments) are crucial for cultivating an engaging
learning experience. However, few studies have examined the specific cohorts of students who revisit
and their behaviour and motivations for revisiting.</p>
<p>The purpose of this research is to identify the factors that contribute to learners revisiting a MOOC. In
order to identify those factors we asked:</p>
	<p><strong>'What can we discover about the behaviour and motivations of revisiting learners from comments in
a MOOC and how can these findings inform the design of MOOCs in the future?'</strong></p>
	<a name="MOOClearners"><h2>MOOC learners</h2></a>
	<p>Many learners take MOOCs to develop or build-on existing skills to enhance their future employability,
shape a goal for further study, connect with people, understand basic concepts or general understanding
and satisfy their curiosity (Zheng, Rosson, Shih and Carrol 2015). Laurillard (2014) noted that a number
of previous studies have shown that most MOOC users are already well educated. In Coursera MOOCs, for
example, an average of 85% of participants have one or more degrees. For London and Edinburgh-based
MOOCs offered in 2013, the figure was around 70%. In their examination of learners taking a five-week
'Introduction to Infographics and Data Visualization' MOOC, Liu, Kang and McKelroy (2015) found the top
two reasons for taking the MOOC were to learn more about the topic for personal reasons (employment
prospects/career readiness) and for their current job. Other main reasons included learning about future
career possibilities, what MOOCs are like, getting course materials, and learning from specific
instructor(s). Achieving a certificate (of completion) and engaging with MOOC takers as a community of
learners were also listed as reasons for taking the MOOC, but resulted in fewer responses. The results
from interviews by Zheng et al., (2015) with learners about their reasons for taking a MOOC support
findings of Liu et al., (2015), where learners revealed they took MOOCs to fulfil their current study
needs, help their current position (as a student or in the workplace), develop a social connection with
others who shared similar interests and also to prepare for future job opportunities or to gain experience
in a field they might study in a more formal manner after taking the MOOC (Zheng et al. 2015).
Reasons for learners taking a MOOC were further explored by Xiong, Kornhaber, Suen, Pursel & Goins
(2015), where they defined a general interest in taking a MOOC as intrinsic motivation, taking a MOOC
for external rewards, such as earning a certificate as extrinsic motivation, and taking a MOOC for
connecting with others as social motivation. As observed by Crues, Bosch, Anderson, Perry, Bhat and Shaik (2018), to this end, the subject matter of the course was also indicative of the reason a learner
might take a MOOC.</p>
	<p>Engle, Mankoff and Carbrey (2015) noted that understanding MOOC students and the characteristics that
lead to their success will enable modification to courses for increased student achievement, while Hew
and Cheung (2008) explored how to promote student contribution in asynchronous online discussions and
Taib, Chuah and Aziz (2017) investigated four unique MOOCs using Assessing MOOC Pedagogy (AMP) to
characterise ten pedagogical dimensions (1) Epistemology, (2) Role of teacher, (3) Focus of activities, (4)
Structure, (5) Approach to content, (6) Feedback, (7) Co-operative learning, (8) Accommodation of
individual differences, (9) Activities or assessments, and (10) User role. These factors noted by research
carried out across a variety of MOOCs (eg., Engle, Mankoff & Carbrey 2015; Hew & Cheung 2008; Taib,
Chuah & Aziz 2017) may seem elementary for a single instance or one-off run of a MOOC, but what of
revisiting learners - those learners who repeatedly join and then continue to actively participate in the
same MOOC over multiple instances? An example of this cohort would be the learners who continue to
		participate in Monash University’s <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/mindfulness-wellbeing-performance">‘Mindfulness for Wellbeing and Peak Performance’</a> and <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/mindfulness-life">‘Maintaining a Mindful
		Life’</a> free to join courses on <a href="https://www.futurelearn.com/">FutureLearn</a>.</p>
	
<a name="Mindfulnessmonash"><h2>Mindfulness at Monash</h2></a>
<p>Mindfulness is an everyday experience. It's about being fully present and fully engaged in each moment in our lives (Chambers 2020). Mindfulness is associated with paying attention and the evidence is suggesting that (training the attention and) learning to pay attention may be the most important skill we ever learn (Hassed n.d.) - it helps us to focus; to stay on task; to communicate more effectively and empathically; to not get caught in cycles of rumination and worry; and to enjoy life more, including life’s simple pleasures (Chambers & Hassed 2015).</p>
	<p>The development of 'Mindfulness for Wellbeing and Peak Performance' (MIND) and the follow-up
complementary ‘Maintaining a Mindful Life’ (MINDLIFE) emerged from Monash's long term interest in the
application of mindfulness in education settings and a partnership with UK-based online learning
platform FutureLearn, which culminated in the first run of MIND in 2015 (Chambers &amp; Hassed 2015).
Since then, a total of 328,091 learners enrolled in MIND across its 14 runs, while a total of 67,690
learners enrolled in MINDLIFE across its 8 runs since 2017. Class Central, an online course aggregator,
reports that <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/report/futurelearn-2019-year-review/">FutureLearn listed MIND as the fifth most popular courses by enrollment numbers since their
first release</a> (Bowden 2019). MIND and MINDLIFE are also listed on <a href="https://www.classcentral.com/collection/top-free-online-courses">Class Central’s Top 100 online courses
of all time</a> - a status based on reviews written by Class Central users.</p>
	<p>While both courses are predicated on mindfulness, in MIND learners cultivate mindfulness techniques to reduce stress and improve wellbeing and work/study performance (possibly for the first time). In MINDLIFE, learners cultivate mindfulness techniques to improve their communication, relationships and emotional health - it builds upon the introductory MIND course and demonstrates to learners how to embed mindfulness into all aspects of life. 
</p>
	<p>MIND and MINDLIFE are four week courses (although MIND was originally designed as a six week course and remained so from Run 1 to Run 7) with a time commitment of 3 hours per week to work through the course material and sample each mindfulness exercise. Sections of each course make extensive use of video (didactic content and bespoke weekly wrap-ups from lead educators) and audio (mindfulness meditations and exercises) as well as text-based explanations of mindfulness concepts. Quizzes, articles and additional reading are also included to provide learners with opportunities to check their understanding or dedicate more time to explore the science of mindfulness in more depth, and to provide additional information to where claims or references to research are made in the course. Given the experiential nature of the courses, learners are strongly encouraged to watch the videos, practise the mindfulness meditations and exercises, share their ideas, reflections and experiences and join in the discussions - each run of the course features two course mentors to ensure appropriate facilitation of the course.

		<h2>Our learners</h2></a>
	<p>Demographic data identifies MIND and MINDLIFE learners to originate from many countries around the world, with the highest number of learners from the United Kingdom, Australia, United States of America, followed by India, Canada, Ireland, Spain, France and New Zealand. Demographic data is gathered via an optional survey at the enrolment stage of the learner journey. For gender, of those learners who responded to the survey, <strong>76%</strong> of learners identified as <strong>female</strong> while <strong>22%</strong> identified as <strong>male</strong>, as shown in <strong>Figure 1</strong>. </p>
	
	
<h4>Figure 1. Gender reported by respondents</h4>
<p>For employment status, <strong>32%</strong> of respondents revealed they work <strong>full time</strong>, <strong>23%</strong> are <strong>retired</strong>, <strong>14%</strong> work <strong>part-time</strong> and <strong>10%</strong> are <strong>self-employed</strong>, as shown in <strong>Figure 2</strong>.</p>
<h4>Figure 2. Employment status reported by respondents</h4>
	
	
	<p>For the age group, <strong>22%</strong> were aged above <strong>65</strong> years of age, <strong>22%</strong> aged between <strong>56</strong> and <strong>65</strong>, 18% aged <strong>46</strong> and <strong>55</strong>, and <strong>15%</strong> aged <strong>36</strong> and <strong>45</strong>, as shown in <strong>Figure 3</strong>.</p>
	<h4>Figure 3. Age reported by respondents</h4>
	<p>Our learners are mostly female, over 36 years of age and employed, which is interesting when compared to enrolment patterns and gender distribution found in MOOCs related to programming, science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM courses), who have a greater number of male learners (Glass, Shiokawa‐Baklan & Saltarelli 2016; Williams, Stafford, Corliss & Reilly 2018).</p>
	
	
<a name="Literaturereview"><h1>Literature review</h1></a>
	<p>Previous studies have identified a range of factors which impact on learner engagement with MOOCs. Given the freeness (no cost to join) of earlier MOOCs, low or no vested interest has been linked to low completion rates (Petronzi & Hadi 2016). Lack of engagement on MOOCs may be due to factors such as connectivity, digital skills, time zones, and institutional power dynamics (Walji, Deacon, Small & Czerniewicz 2016), or even disaffection with forum and peer-related issues (Hew, 2018). As noted by Walji et al. (2016), simply using a (MOOC) platform that promotes social learning is, of course, not enough for engaged learning to happen. Other studies identified factors that MOOC learners find engaging in large-scale open online courses, for example Hew, Quao & Tang (2016) surfaced themes in their data of structure and pace, video, instructors, content and resources, interaction and support, and assignments and assessments. These themes were surfaced by carrying out a machine learning classifier to analyse 24,612 reflective sentences posted by 5,884 students, who participated in one or more of 18 highly rated MOOCs. While an analysis of three top-rated MOOCs in the disciplines of programming languages, literature, and arts & design undertaken by Hew (2016) revealed problem-centric learning with clear expositions, instructor accessibility and passion, peer interaction, active learning, and course resources to address participant learning needs to be design factors found in a well-received MOOC.
</p>
	
	<a name="Learninglifestyle"><h2>Learning or lifestyle</h2></a>
	<p>According to Horrigan (2016), people undertake learning for personal and professional reasons. <strong>Personal learners</strong> often choose learning opportunities that are likely to increase their knowledge and skills that benefit themselves and others. <strong>Professional learners</strong> often choose learning opportunities that are likely to maintain or improve their knowledge and skills. Curious about their own cohort, FutureLearn carried out their own research to develop a better understanding of learners that join courses on their platform. This resulted in findings that grouped learners into <strong>seven different types of people</strong>, or archetypes that fit into <strong>three different areas</strong> (1) Work and Study, (2) Leisure, and (3) Personal Life (FutureLearn 2018). Within the group 'Work and Study', there are three archetypes; Advancers, Explorers and Preparers, while the 'Leisure' group also features two archetypes: hobbyists and vitalisers. 'Personal Life' consists of two archetypes: Fixers and Flourishers. As reported by FutureLearn (2019), Fixers learn in order to understand or manage current aspects of their personal life, including physical or mental health, while Flourishers enjoy self-help learning in order to be happy and healthy in their personal and professional lives. Each archetype in each area has a unique need and motivation for learning.</p>
	<p>Irrespective of the learner’s inclination for undertaking learning, the opportunity must be flexible and permit the learner drop-in and out at their discretion, often at intervals throughout their life, much like ‘a personal learning continuum, rather than as unrelated, separate gatherings’ (Bozkurt & Keefer 2018). Communities that foster a culture of participatory learning contribute to the premise of lifelong learning, something to be part of, a sense ‘that the teaching and learning experience, the idea of imagining where you stand within that environment is something that’s akin to the DIY punk experience‘ (Groom 2016). While it is possible for an online course to cultivate an environment for this type of experience, it's an environment that is suited for a learner that is self-determined, attentive, can think critically, reason, and is ready to collaborate (Pegrum 2009). The presence of instructors is critical, where they support learners, the development of a community of learning, all the while gently guiding learners through the course. These varying reasons elicit the question as to why learners continue to participate and persist with a course and continue to engage in the community of learning. </p><p>As MOOCs are voluntary, is it possible that learners simply enjoy being part of a community or their goals to deepen their knowledge and skills are being met, or is it the convenience, ease of use and flexibility afforded by the platform, or possibly even something else entirely that’s related to their individual needs that’s being served? 
</p>
	
	
	
	<a name="Revisiter"><h2>Revisiter: defining the repeat MOOC learner</h2></a>
	<p>For the purposes of this study, a revisiter is a learner who has enrolled in more than one run of either of Monash's mindfulness course on FutureLearn between 2016 and 2020, with some learners having revisited since the first run of MIND in 2015. Returning and re-take are terms used in other studies to describe repeated participation. 
</p><p>As a phenomenon, there's not a lot of research available on the motivations of returning MOOC learners. In their investigation of learners returning to a teacher professional development MOOC, Chen, Fan, Zhang & Qiong (2017) found that learners were possibly motivated by the opportunity to improve their grades, refresh their theoretical understanding, and solve practical problems. Although the focus of their study was learner intention to revisit, Huang, Zhang & Liu (2017) found vividness, teacher subject knowledge and interactivity to be effective towards revisiting.  Viewing returning learners through a non-MOOC lens, Woodgate, Macleod, Scott & Haywood (2015) note how it's uncommon for students to re-take higher education courses, given the cost, time commitment and other regulations that may limit participation. As they also note, the affordances of MOOCs (openness and freeness) creates opportunities for students to re-take a course and then engage in mastery learning, a philosophy and set of instructional strategies (Guskey 2012) designed to promote a student's capacity to practise a skill or knowledge. Because mindfulness is an open-ended skill that requires perseverance and time for learning, which are two key variables that promote mastery learning (Bloom 1968), the recurring runs of MIND and MINDLIFE create opportunities for learners to join and revisit the courses due to their no natural limit to continuation or expansion (Degree of Freedom 2013). 
</p>
	<p>What other motivations are there for learners to revisit? On the course description of MIND on FutureLearn, learners noted the flexibility of the course content and design, its capacity for enabling mastery learning and its applicability to changing personal and world events, stating
</p>
	<p><em>'Despite this being a re-run, the content was kept up-to-date with current situations and the application of mindfulness as an aid to dealing with the impact that the pandemic is having felt very relevant',

'Excellent course and perfect during COVID-19',</em>
</p>
	<p><em>'I found this course particularly useful and pertinent in this time of COVID, but I am sure in life generally',</em></p>

<p><em>'I started this course during our most recent lockdown, and found that the course content and mindfulness practice couldn't have come at a better time'</em>
</p>
	<p>and<br>
<em>'I thoroughly enjoyed this course and the way it was presented. I have learnt a great deal and I have found this very useful especially during COVID-19 and working from home'.
</em></p>
	<p>Learners (Class Central 2018) who participated in either or both of the mindfulness-related offerings by Monash reported 
</p>
	<p><em>‘The two courses that I have been blessed with the opportunity to do on a number of ocassions [sic] have really enhanced the quality of not just my life but those who share their lives with me in any way. I am simply a better person for the learnings that I have had through undertaking the courses’, </em></p>

<p><em>‘I have found the leaders, […], really engaging and great role models for their subject, being calm, measured and reassuring, but also inspirational and encouraging. The strength of the course is their rapport in the short videos and audios which acknowledge human frailty and make the continuing practice of mindfulness seem vital and attainable in daily life.’ </em></p>

<p><em>‘I plan to take the course again when it is offered in November, so I can delve more deeply into this more authentic way of viewing the world and living my life’. </em>
</p>
	<p>These statements go some way to providing some insight into ongoing learner participation. Furthermore, the learner sentiment expressed towards the mindfulness related offerings is somewhat akin to the model proposed by Peltier, Drago, and Schibrowsky (2003), that identified student-to-student interactions, student-instructor interactions and instructor support and mentoring, as well as course content, course structure and information delivery technology to key components to learner perceived quality of the online learning experience. 
</p>
	<p>Vividness is defined as the quality of being very clear, powerful and detailed in your mind (Campbell, Fuller & Hess 2009). When applied to digital experiences, through the use of multimedia components such as video, text, voice and animation, for example, vividness is a media capability (Campbell et al. 2009) that should engage and fully immerse the user in a sensorially rich mediated environment that appeals to multiple senses (Coyle & Thurston 2001) that are associated with increased feelings of being elsewhere. While multimedia vividness is associated with increased feelings of telepresence, vividness of course content in a MOOC (which are often sensorially rich mediated environments) has been found to be positively associated with a student's intention to revisit (Huang, Zhang & Liu 2017), meaning an individual's readiness or willingness to make a repeat visit to the same destination (Stylos, Vassiliadis, Bellou & Andronikidis 2016).

	<h2>Research gap</h2>
	<h1>Research methodology</h1>
<a name="Methodology"><h2>Methodology</h2></a>
	<p>For researchers who want to develop a better understanding of the experiences and motivations of learners in a MOOC, comments made by learners in the MOOC provide a rich and authentic data source that can provide invaluable insights because they can potentially reveal the underlying reasons for learner activity. For this study, quiz responses, step activity and enrolment information as well as learner comments were used to uncover revisiting learners - these data sets are made readily available to partners of FutureLearn. By using available data sets from FutureLearn rather than independently surveying learners, it is possible to link freshly caught 'wild comments' made by learners to their level of engagement, activity and number of times they revisited the MOOC. Using available data sets also means that the comments are taken from the 'wild' or made within the naturally occurring context of their learning and course revisiting experience and not in response to an additional survey. The use of freshly caught comments isn't without its problems, mainly the lack of clarity and directness generally afforded by survey questions. These comments require analysis, thematic coding, interpretation and distillation of themes have potential to lack precision. Using a survey, revisiting learners could be invited to respond to questions asking them specifically about their revisiting, their reasons for doing so, and explore the behavioural and affective outcomes of their revisiting, and more. Although the use of a survey may result in more direct responses, this approach is challenged by being optional and not strictly related to the course experience, which may reduce the number and consistency of interested respondents (particularly revisiting learners) over time. It's worth noting that the FutureLearn platform does permit partners to invite learners to participate in research, but given the constraints of <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> and its impact on direct communication with learners, the potential for an invitation to reach a large number of learners (from current and past course runs) is extremely limited. </p>

<p>To further investigate the outcomes identified in the comments, case studies of a small group of visiting learners were undertaken to develop a better understanding of their motivations and underlying behaviour and emotions. While the use of case studies provide a unique opportunity to find out more about an individual learner or small instance of learners in a real life context, their usefulness in telling a broader story about revisiting learners may be limited.

	<a name="Researchmethods"><h2>Research methods</h2></a>
	<p>This project has approval from the Deakin University Arts and Education Faculty Human Ethics Advisory Group (HAE-20-081). This project is based on data sets from each run of MIND and MINDLIFE which were made available to Monash University from FutureLearn for research purposes in a de-identified form. The data consists of de-identified:
</p>
	<ul>
	<li>student comments from runs of the course between 2015 and 2020 made by students during the course of their learning
</li><li>data analytics of student engagement with different steps in the course (number of clicks, time on page, number of comments, number of replies)</li><li>enrolments, demographics (age and country), sentiment and survey data (pre-course, leaving).</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This data has been collected by FutureLearn and used by Monash University as a partner institution to monitor and improve learning and teaching within the MOOC over a number of iterations of the course. While the data-sets used for this research are provided in a de-identified form, it would be possible for students, teachers and moderators in the specific iteration of the MOOC to go back into the MOOC, search for a specific comment, and identify the public profile of the student who made that comment. <b>For this reason, no comments will be quoted in the research paper or any subsequent publications to ensure no student is able to be identified from the outcomes of this research.</b> Learners have consented to this use of the data as part of the Terms and Conditions (Privacy Policy/Research ethics) of their enrolment with FutureLearn. This includes their consent to their data being used for research purposes, and an acknowledgement by the learners that their comments will not be quoted directly in any publications without their permission. Data sets of learner enrolment, step activity and learner comments in comma separated values (CSV) file format were sourced from course runs between 2015 and 2020 of Monash University’s ‘Mindfulness for Wellbeing and Peak Performance’ (MIND) and ‘Maintaining a Mindful Life’ (MINDLIFE) free to join courses on FutureLearn. Data from MINDLIFE was investigated and no further additional information as found, so this study focuses on MIND. </p>

	<p>It's worth noting that <b>Run 3</b> and <b>Run 10</b> of <b>MIND</b> were not included as data sources because they were closed/private runs of the course, which meant learner comments, learner activity and even motivation for joining the course would be incongruent with the open/free to join course offering. 
</p>
	<p>The CSV files were imported into Microsoft Excel and then exported as Microsoft Excel files for greater flexibility and utility. Quantitative analysis of enrolment data was carried out in Excel. Because FutureLearn considers team members as enrolments, additional work was done to remove course team members (lead educators, course mentors, course developers and designers) and reviewers (non-team members/miscellaneous personnel) from all data sets to ensure accurate enrolment numbers. Then, pivot tables and concatenation were used to calculate the total number of revisiting joiners (learners who enrolled in more than one run of the course).
</p>
	<p>The data files were then imported into NVivo 12 for 'coding' of themes. During the initial analysis of the data in NVivo, a number of themes were identified. Further analysis of the themes using the lens of learner archetypes and behavioural and affective/emotional subthemes was undertaken. The analysis revealed two main groups of revisiting learners based on the frequency and pattern of their revisiting. These two groups were then explored further, which resulted in a number of case studies that mapped each revisiting learner's journey through each course run.  
</p>
	<p>Ten revisiting learners were identified as case studies based on the number and frequency of their revisits, step activity, quiz responses and comments. Because FutureLearn allocates a unique identification number to each learner when they create their FutureLearn profile, it was possible to link data sets together and map the journey of each revisiting learner. Two main groups of revisiting learners were identified in the data: 'Sequencers' and 'Syncopators'. 'Sequencers' revisited a course offering multiple times one after the other in a sequence without a break, while 'Syncopators' revisited multiple times non sequentially, on the off-beat or revisiting after a long break (sometimes more than 12 months between revisits). From ten revisiting learners initially identified, four learners were selected as case studies to represent two groups of revisiters.

<h1>Results and discussion</h1>
<h2>Enrolments and revisits</h2>
	<p>Combined, a total number of <b>33,990</b> revisiting learners joined a Monash mindfulness offering between Monday 14 September 2015 and Monday 29 May 2020. It's worth noting that this number is determined by enrolments and does not represent active learners - typically, around 4% of learners leave a course run. There were <b>27,957</b> revisiting learners who joined MIND between Run 1 (14 September 2015) and Run 16 (16 March 2020). <b>Table 2</b> summarises the number of revisits and the number of joiners, from highest to lowest for MIND.</p>

<a name="Conclusion"><h1>Conclusion</h1></a>
	<p>The purpose of this research was to identify the factors that contribute to learners revisiting a MOOC. Some clear conclusions can be drawn from our data about revisiting learners of Monash's MIND courses on FutureLearn, which we were able to do because of their engagement in the course. First time course participants may join for the content, but then choose to revisit for the community, course team, content updates and the impact that revisiting has on the way they act and feel. </p>

<p>Analysis of the comments revealed a range of reasons learners revisited. These include how they'd developed a greater awareness of emotions, attitudes, stress response and how to manage them, and established or continued their formal mindfulness practice, but benefited from ongoing participation in the course as a (daily) reminder to re-establish their lapsed mindfulness practice. Reasons for revisiting also highlighted the importance of community, which demonstrates the value that revisiters place on a sense of community or affinity of a group of like-minded people that support each other throughout the course. This is connected to the role of the course team (lead educators and course mentors), where the way the course team engages, interacts and models mindful behaviour to learners, which is another contributing factor for revisiting. 

	
</p>
<a name="Limitations">
		<h2>Limitations and further study</h2></a>
<p>Although there was a large volume of data with a large number of revisiting learners made available from FutureLearn, one limitation to this study was the use of the single data source. While this approach allowed linkages between comments, activity and revisiting by learners it lacks the clarity and directness afforded by direct surveying of learners. This study was also limited by the open-ended skills-based nature of the MOOC that's predicated on a lifelong practice, so it may not be representative of other MOOCs - this may reduce the applicability of the findings. </p>
	<p>As a consequence of this study, the most immediate future research would be to conduct specific questioning of revisiters to Monash's mindfulness offerings. This would take the form of a survey which asks them specifically about their revisiting, their reasons for doing so, and explore the behavioural and affective outcomes of their revisiting. Then, subsequent research could be carried out to determine if the factors that contribute to revisiting Monash's mindfulness MOOCs are representative of MOOCs more broadly or specific only to mindfulness or other open-ended skills-based MOOCs, or even other thematically MOOCs by other organisations.
</p>
	
	<a name="Learnings">
	<h2>Learnings for course designers</h2></a>
	<p>Understanding the factors that contribute to learner revisiting is of interest to all organisations that offer online learning experiences (particularly those that are experiential or open-ended with no logical conclusion) because it may provide insights on how to best design, develop and deliver of the experience. 
</p>
	<p>Combined, a total number of 33,990 revisiting learners joined a Monash mindfulness offering between 2015 and 2020. Given the high number of revisiting learners, the course design needs to acknowledge that many learners have experienced the content (watched videos, completed quizzes and practised meditations) before, if not many times before. The course design also needs to acknowledge that the learners have experienced the content at a particular stage of their learning continuum or development of their mindfulness practice, which then impacts their experience of that content. Because of this, designers should endeavour to offer opportunities that scale up to the changing needs of learners such as additional readings, additional content and practices (that are portable/mobile friendly) bundled with the support of the course team ready to guide learners through the course.
</p>
	<p>It's usual for course designers to refresh course content based on advances or new research findings in the area, but it's crucial for designers to recognise revisiting learners as a cohort and to include elements that meet their changing needs and are of value to them. These elements could include providing 'live' additional content and responses from the course team that are timely, relevant and situated within the learner's personal (and global) context of the course delivery. For example, supporting material such as articles, research papers or articles and recording 'freshly minted' weekly feedback videos related to hot topics discussed by learners throughout the week and 'additional' video content that's available outside of the course and can be accessed 'between the gaps' of each run. The temporal nature of the weekly feedback videos and their run-specific dialogue may also contribute to the uniqueness, depth or efficiency of the revisiting experience. For example, learners in course runs in first-half of 2020 commented specifically about how the course was helping them to better manage their experience of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>
	<p>Revisiters value community, so course design needs to ensure opportunities for conversation and rich discussion between learners and the course team as well as learners and other learners, in response to course content and prompts. Another contributing factor to a sense of community is the presence of the educators/course team throughout the delivery. As part of the course design consider how different modalities (for example, discussion forums, feedback videos or weekly emails to learners, or even 'office hours') can be used to cultivate an educator presence and interactions between learners.  
</p>
<p>When designing an online course, course teams should consider the intended audience and their typical characteristics, behaviour, needs and motivations for learning: the outcomes or behavioural or affective change is desired by the (revisiting) learner. FutureLearn have been able to define seven learner archetypes, of which two ('Flourisher' and 'Fixer') were revisiting Monash's mindfulness MOOCs. 
</p>	
<p>These learners are motivated by the physical or mental health of themselves or people close to them, situations requiring practical life skills or major life changes. These learners are also motivated to manage stress, be enriched, build self-esteem, help others or improve relationships. These types of motivations go beyond learning about mindfulness, and extend into life outside of the course. The course design could create opportunities for these learners to further embed what they've learned into a lifelong practice by providing access to content (for offline use/outside of course) and tools (apps, journal templates, downloadable checklists) for learners to practice and also reflect on their experience.
